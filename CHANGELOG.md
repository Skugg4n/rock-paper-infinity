# Changelog

## v1.3.14 - 2025-11-26 09:14 UTC
- Restored the Stage 2 factory smoke animation with darker, larger plumes and staggered timing so the icon stream is visible again.
- Made Stage 2 reset fully clear saves by disabling auto-save before reload, stopping timers, and removing stored progress keys.
- Bumped version metadata to v1.3.14 to reflect the fixes.

## v1.3.13 - 2025-11-26 07:51 UTC
- Added a dedicated Plånboken (Bank) hover tooltip so the Stage 1 exit upgrade explains the transition before clicking.
- Replaced the Stage 2 factory orbit animation with a steady stream of rising rock/paper/scissors icons to read as industrial "rök".
- Reworked the Stage 2 supply meter to fill from the center with green surplus and red deficit cues for faster balance checks.
- Made housing demolition immediately recalculate population and downstream rates, keeping counts in sync even for massive districts.
- Clarified stars generated per person in Stage 2 to track base and industry-effective output and bumped release version metadata.

## v1.3.12 - 2025-11-24 07:37 UTC
- Switched all visible interface text to English and refreshed version labels to avoid language confusion between stages.
- Added a missing bank icon asset for the Stage 1 transition so the final upgrade renders correctly instead of an empty box.
- Exposed stars-per-person output in Stage 2 and added a rock-paper-scissors-inspired factory animation to reinforce the core theme and clarify efficiency upgrades.
- Redesigned the Stage 2 supply "thermometer" into a centered deficit/surplus meter with clearer surplus/deficit messaging for quicker balance checks.
- Made population drop instantly when demolishing housing to keep resident counts aligned with available buildings even for large districts.
- Bumped version metadata and documented these fixes to keep releases traceable.
