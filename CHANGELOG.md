# Changelog

## v1.3.12 - 2025-11-24 07:37 UTC
- Switched all visible interface text to English and refreshed version labels to avoid language confusion between stages.
- Added a missing bank icon asset for the Stage 1 transition so the final upgrade renders correctly instead of an empty box.
- Exposed stars-per-person output in Stage 2 and added a rock-paper-scissors-inspired factory animation to reinforce the core theme and clarify efficiency upgrades.
- Redesigned the Stage 2 supply "thermometer" into a centered deficit/surplus meter with clearer surplus/deficit messaging for quicker balance checks.
- Made population drop instantly when demolishing housing to keep resident counts aligned with available buildings even for large districts.
- Bumped version metadata and documented these fixes to keep releases traceable.
